CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT SCALING:
Formula: M_Ch ∝ (ℏc/G)^(3/2)

In our scenario: G → G×10³⁶, ℏ → ℏ×10¹⁸
M_Ch(scaled) = 1.4 M☉ × (10¹⁸/10³⁶)^(3/2)
             = 1.4 M☉ × (10⁻¹⁸)^(3/2)
             = 1.4 M☉ × 10⁻²⁷
             = 2,800 kg (mass of a small car!)

IMPLICATION: Earth (6×10²⁴ kg) is 10²¹ times
ABOVE the new Chandrasekhar limit. This explains
why Earth becomes a degenerate object in our
scaled universe – NOT because it reaches the
original limit, but because the limit itself
has dropped so dramatically!
