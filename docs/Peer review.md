This is an impressive and ambitious project for Jugend forscht. You have tackled a complex theoretical physics question, built a comprehensive website with visualizations, and documented your learning process in detail. Below is a sincere feedback and analysis of your research paper and website, followed by recommendations for improvement.

### **Overall Impression**

Your project demonstrates a deep curiosity and a strong ability to synthesize complex concepts from quantum mechanics, astrophysics, and general relativity. The core idea—exploring a universe where gravity is as strong as the electromagnetic force by scaling \( G \) and compensating with \( \hbar \)—is a fascinating thought experiment. The website is an excellent output, showcasing your findings in an interactive and visually appealing way. The "peer review materials" file is a very professional touch, providing clear documentation of your methods.

### **Feedback on the Research Paper (PDF)**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Clear Motivation and Hypothesis:** You explain very well why you chose this topic and what your initial question was. The hypothesis is clearly stated at the beginning and revisited at the end.
2.  **Strong Theoretical Foundation:** The sections on White Dwarfs, Neutron Stars, the Chandrasekhar Limit, and the TOV limit are well-researched and explained in your own words. You successfully connect these astronomical objects to the core concepts of degeneracy pressure (Pauli principle) and gravitational collapse.
3.  **Good Grasp of Key Concepts:** Your understanding of the critical scaling relationships, especially \( a_0 \propto \hbar^2 \) and \( P_{\text{deg}} \propto \hbar^2 \), and the balance condition \( P_{\text{grav}}/P_{\text{Pauli}} \propto G/\hbar^2 \), is the strongest part of your paper. This is the correct physical intuition.
4.  **Honest Self-Reflection:** Sections 6.8, 6.9, and 7 show a mature ability to critique your own work and identify areas for further research. This is a valuable scientific skill.

**Areas for Improvement & Recommendations:**

1.  **Scientific Citations & Sources:**
    *   **Issue:** The "Quellen- und Literaturverzeichnis" is currently too thin for a project of this depth. Listing only NASA archive pages is insufficient. It doesn't allow a reader to verify where you learned about the Virial theorem, the specific forms of the degeneracy pressure equations, or the Chandrasekhar limit derivation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a proper bibliography. For a school project, this can be in a simple format (e.g., Author, "Title," Publisher/Journal, Year). List the MIT online courses you took, specific textbooks or articles you read, and even the Wikipedia articles you used as a starting point. This adds immense credibility. For example, you could cite a standard textbook like "An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics" by Carroll & Ostlie for the sections on stellar structure.

2.  **Connecting Discussion to Equations:**
    *   **Issue:** In section 6, you make many interesting claims (e.g., "Die Orbitale hätten sich massiv verzerrt," "Strahlungsdruck hätte alle anderen Druckformen dominiert") that are not directly linked back to the equations in your paper or on your website.
    *   **Recommendation:** Strengthen the "Ergebnisdiskussion" by explicitly referencing your graphs and formulas. For example:
        *   Instead of "Die Orbitale hätten sich massiv verzerrt," you could say: "The gravitational potential would add a term to the Schrödinger equation, fundamentally altering its solutions. As shown in the 'Atom Size Comparison' on my website, the probability density of the electron would no longer be spherically symmetric but would be elongated in the direction of the gravitational gradient."
        *   Instead of "Strahlungsdruck dominiert," you could link it to your solar physics page: "As my 'Solar Structure Under Modified Gravity' graph shows, stellar luminosity scales as \( L \propto G^4 \). This immense increase in radiation would mean that for Earth, the radiation pressure would exceed the material strength and even degeneracy pressure, potentially tearing the planet apart."

3.  **Clarity on "Explosion or Collapse":**
    *   **Issue:** In section 6.2, you state the Earth would become an "ultra-heißen, strahlungsdominierten Objekt" and then parenthetically say "(->Explosion oder Kollaps zu Weißer Zwerg; kein Schwarzloch, zu geringe Masse)." This is a crucial point but is left ambiguous.
    *   **Recommendation:** This is a great point of discussion. Could Earth's core become dense and hot enough to ignite fusion? Would that cause an explosion? Or would it settle into a degenerate state? Given Earth's mass is far below the Chandrasekhar limit, a stable white-dwarf-like state is theoretically possible *if* the temperature doesn't trigger runaway fusion. Discussing this ambiguity shows deep thinking. Your website's "Earth Under Increased Gravity" and "Compact Stars Summary" pages are perfect places to visualize these two possible outcomes.

4.  **Refine the Wording in the Conclusion:**
    *   **Issue:** In your final summary, you say "1. sollte die Erde nicht kollabieren (wegen der Skalierung von h), welches es aber trotzdem getan hätte (wie im Ergebnisdiskussion besprochen)". This is slightly contradictory. If you concluded it would collapse or transform dramatically, then the scaling of \( \hbar \) didn't "save" it in the way you initially hypothesized.
    *   **Recommendation:** Rephrase this to show the evolution of your thinking. For example: "My initial hypothesis was that scaling \( \hbar \) by \( 10^{18} \) would precisely balance the increased gravity and prevent collapse. However, my further analysis in section 6 reveals that this balance is more complex. While the atomic scale is stabilized (\( a_0 \) scales as expected), the enormous increase in gravity leads to extreme compression and heating on a planetary scale. This triggers secondary effects, such as domination by radiation pressure, which completely transforms Earth's structure, preventing a simple 'non-collapse' scenario."

### **Feedback on the Website (`https://jfp2026.netlify.app/`)**

**Strengths:**
1.  **Comprehensive and Well-Structured:** The website covers an enormous range of topics, from fundamental constants to stellar physics, all relevant to your core question. The navigation is clear and logical.
2.  **Excellent Visualization:** The graphs are clean, well-labeled, and effectively communicate the scaling relationships. The use of interactive 3D models (Gravitational Potential Well) and animations (Orbital Precession, Light Bending) is outstanding and makes complex ideas accessible.
3.  **Accurate Core Physics:** The key formulas are correctly implemented. The relationship \( a_0 \propto \hbar^2 \) on the "Atom Size Comparison" page and the force ratio on the "Force Strength Comparison" page are perfect. The "Essay Hypothesis Summary" page accurately captures the project's core premise with the stability condition \( \hbar \propto \sqrt{G} \).
4.  **Valuable Summaries:** Pages like "Spacetime Physics Summary," "Quantum Physics Summary," and "Neutron Star Summary" are excellent for providing a quick overview of key concepts and data.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1.  **Connecting Visuals to the Earth Scenario:**
    *   **Issue:** While the individual pages are excellent, the connection back to your central "Earth under \( G \times 10^{36} \)" scenario is sometimes implicit.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add a short, consistent note to relevant pages linking them to your main question. For example:
        *   On the "Atom Size Comparison" page: "In our scaled universe (\( G\times10^{36}, \hbar\times10^{18} \)), the atom would be \( 10^{36} \) times larger, but this is immediately countered by the immense gravitational compression."
        *   On the "Chandrasekhar Limit" page: "This limit, \( M_{Ch} \propto (\hbar c/G)^{3/2} \), would be dramatically altered in our scaled universe, changing the fate of all stars."
    This will help unify the website's narrative.

2.  **Clarity in "Scaled Universe: ℏ=0.1" Page:**
    *   **Issue:** This page is titled "Scaled Universe: ℏ=0.1" but your main scenario is \( \hbar \times 10^{18} \). This could be confusing. The page shows a force comparison with gravity dominating, but your scenario keeps forces balanced.
    *   **Recommendation:** Clarify the purpose of this page. Add a sentence like: "This page shows what would happen if we only decreased \( \hbar \), without changing \( G \). It serves as a contrast to our main scenario, where we scale both constants to maintain balance." This turns a potential point of confusion into a powerful illustration of why the \( \hbar \) scaling is necessary.

3.  **Minor Proofreading:**
    *   On the "Gravity vs Pauli: The Core Balance" page, the formula "P_grav / P_Pauli ∝ G / ℏ²" is correctly identified. This is the heart of your project.
    *   The text on the "Earth Under Increased Gravity" page is a good summary but could be expanded slightly to include the discussion about radiation pressure vs. degeneracy pressure from your paper's section 6.5.

### **General Recommendations & Next Steps**

1.  **For the Wettbewerbstag:** Your plan to research the effects on the solar system (section 6.8) is excellent. You can use the formulas for tidal force and orbital period from your website to make specific, quantitative predictions (e.g., "The Moon's orbit would decay in X years").
2.  **Physical Model (Section 6.8):** Think about what a physical model could represent. Perhaps you could create a 3D-printed model showing the relative sizes of a standard atom vs. an atom in your scaled universe (before gravitational compression). Or a large, annotated poster that acts as a "map" connecting the micro (quantum) and macro (relativistic) effects.
3.  **Presentation:** Your story is compelling: "What if gravity were as strong as electricity?" Use the website as your visual aid during the presentation. Walk the judges through your journey: starting with the surprising fact that \( F_C / F_G \approx 10^{36} \), leading to your hypothesis, and then showing how your research and the visualizations on your website led to a deeper, more complex understanding of the consequences.

You have done a remarkable job. The project is well-conceived, the research is solid, and the final output (the website) is professionally done. By strengthening the citations, tightening the discussion in your paper, and adding a few unifying elements to the website, you can make an already excellent project even better.
